## Challenges

- **2026-01-10** — [Tic Tac Toe](./2026-01-10_tic-tac-toe.py)
    - It looks pretty inefficient, I mean I think there is a better way to do this. I suppose if statement conditions is the most easy to do.

- **2026-01-11** — [Par for the Hole](./2026-01-11_par_for_the_hole.py)
    - Took me while, I have no idea what is the rules or scoring in golf. I just ball it like, if I saw a hole, ball must go in.

- **2026-01-15** — [Array Swap](./2026-01-15_array_swap.py)
    - It seems I just raw dog this one, but hey, it works.

- **2026-01-16** — [Integer Hypotenuse](./2026-01-16_integer_hypotenuse.py)
    - It took me while that what I only need to know is if it is `perfect square` or not, so I should just return in `True` or `False` through some kind of condition. What really took me long is this part `c_root = int(c ** 0.5)`, I have to put `int()` in it for it to work properly with other test cases.
