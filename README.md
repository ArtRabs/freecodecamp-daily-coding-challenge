## Challenges

- **2026-01-10** — [Tic Tac Toe](./2026-01-10_tic-tac-toe.py)
    - It looks pretty inefficient, I mean I think there is a better way to do this. I suppose if statement conditions is the most easy to do.

- **2026-01-11** — [Par for the Hole](./2026-01-11_par_for_the_hole.py)
    - Took me while, I have no idea what is the rules or scoring in golf. I just ball it like, if I saw a hole, ball must go in.

- **2026-01-15** — [Array Swap](./2026-01-15_array_swap.py)
    - It seems I just raw dog this one, but hey, it works.
