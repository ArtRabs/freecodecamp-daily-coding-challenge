## Challenges

- **2026-01-10** — [Tic Tac Toe](./2026-01-10_tic-tac-toe.py)
    - It looks pretty inefficient, I mean I think there is a better way to do this. I suppose if statement conditions is the most easy to do.

- **2026-01-11** — [Par for the Hole](./2026-01-11_par_for_the_hole.py)
    - Took me while, I have no idea what is the rules or scoring in golf. I just ball it like, if I saw a hole, ball must go in.

- **2026-01-12** - [Plant the Crop](./2026-01-12_plant_the_crop.py)
    - I am thinking of using `while` or `for` in getting the... the that... I do not know. The plants things, yes. Well I will just give an example. `corn = 1` square meter, `wheat = 0.1` square meters, `soybeans = 0.5` square meter, `tomatoes = 0.25` square meters, `lettuce = 0.2` square meters. corn is already 1 so it is ok, but if soybeans is 0.5, in the math it should by times 2, if tomatoes then times 4, if wheat then times 10. With that, I think we get the point and know what is lettuce output. What I want to do is to automatically convert the square meter/s of crops to the times of it. `soybeans = 0.5, then soybeans = 2` or `if tomatoes = 0.25, then tomatoes = 4` like that, but I did not do it then just raw dog it once more.

- **2026-01-15** — [Array Swap](./2026-01-15_array_swap.py)
    - It seems I just raw dog this one, but hey, it works.

- **2026-01-16** — [Integer Hypotenuse](./2026-01-16_integer_hypotenuse.py)
    - It took me while that what I only need to know is if it is `perfect square` or not, so I should just return in `True` or `False` through some kind of condition. What really took me long is this part `c_root = int(c ** 0.5)`, I have to put `int()` in it for it to work properly with other test cases.

- **2026-01-18** — [Free Shipping](./2026-01-18_free_shipping.py)
    - It is pretty simple, I just review `dict` earlier so I have done it easily.

- **2026-01-19** — [Energy Consumption](./2026-01-19_energy_consumption.py)
    - Another day that took me while, I only need to times `calories_burned` with `calorie` and `watt_hours_used` with `watt_hour` and call it a day.

- **2026-01-20** — [Consonant Case](./2026-01-20_consonant_case.py)
    - The `elif case in ("aeiou" or "AEIOU")` stuck me up for too long, because the code reads the `"aeiou"` part only and call it a day, I changed it to `"aeiouAEIOU"` and I call it a night (night because it took me so long, it is so simple, very simple).
